// Input limits for the calculator core (docs/calculator-build-plan.md, section 11).
//
// Every limit is a hard cap enforced BEFORE the work starts, so a hostile or accidental
// input is rejected with a message that names the limit instead of hanging the UI or
// dying on a stack overflow. The values were chosen from measurements on this machine:
//
//   - A flat 10,001-term sum (numbers + operators, no nesting) evaluated in 3.7 ms, and
//     parsing it is linear in length, so 10,000 characters is a real ceiling for typing
//     but not a burden on the engine. Anything longer is not something a person types.
//   - Each parenthesis level costs a few parser/evaluator frames. 200 levels is far past
//     any formula (the deepest realistic ones are ~20), while staying well inside the
//     default JS stack even with the evaluator's own frames on top.
//   - Statistics run in exact decimal, so cost grows with the dataset. 100,000 values is
//     already more than a spreadsheet column; the 50,000-value requirement with time to
//     spare is the reason it is not lower.
//   - A 50x50 matrix is more than anyone types by hand, and Gauss-Jordan on 50x50 exact
//     decimals finishes in well under a second. Bigger matrices belong in a different tool.
//   - A script is a program, not an expression: 20,000 characters holds a few hundred
//     lines, which is the point where the step cap, not the size, becomes the limit.
//   - the script step cap cannot be raised by callers: it is the sandbox's guarantee
//     that a loop cannot freeze the UI.
//   - The exponent cap follows from arbitrary-precision arithmetic: 10^100000 has 100,001
//     digits and is quick, 10^999999999 has a billion and is not. The magnitude cap bounds
//     results that grow through factorials and exponents.
